# Portfolio

My personal portfolio built with Next.js 14, Typescript and TailwindCSS.

The UI prototype is avaliable in this [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/9L3aWzeqchYkQYRFBCARHm/Portfolio-%5Bv3.0%5D?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=UIt6YhZoRBQiLa5A-1) file.

## Building your own portfolio
You can use this repository to build your own portfolio, so feel free to clone it and edit whatever you'd like.

First, clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dougdomingos/portfolio.git
```

Then, go to the repository folder and run `yarn && yarn dev`. This will install all the dependencies and get the development server up and running.

Finally, open your browser and go to `localhost:3000/`, and now you're good to go!

### Using NPM
If you don't want to use Yarn as your package manager, delete the `yarn.lock` file and run `npm install`.
