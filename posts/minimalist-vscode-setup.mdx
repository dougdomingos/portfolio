How many hours have you spent in front of your screen, trying to solve that one
tricky bug? Probably more than you can count, right? For that reason, it's
important to have a setup that is comfortable for the eyes. But depending on how
picky you are about themes, configuring your code editor might take quite a
while.

Here, I'm going to show you how to set up a minimalist theme for VSCode that
I've been using recently, going from fonts and icon themes to Code's
configurations and extensions. So hop on and let's go :rocket:

## Themes and Icons

You've probably already spended a dozen of hours scrolling through Code's
(almost) infinite list of theme extensions, trying one after the another, and
later removing them because "they don't feel right". I do this myself from time
to time. Check out some of my favorites:

- [Min Theme (Miguel Solorio)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=miguelsolorio.min-theme):
  This is the theme I'm currently using. The color palette is very pleasing,
  modern and really gives of a minimalist vibe (at least for me :laughing:)
- [Omni Theme (Rocketseat)](https://github.com/getomni/visual-studio-code): If
  you enjoy the color palette of the Dracula theme, you're gonna love this one.
  Has a great contrast and colorful syntax highlighting
- [Ayu Themes (teabyii)](https://vscodethemes.com/e/teabyii.ayu/ayu-dark): This
  collection of themes reminds the palette of the IntelliJ IDE, with a great
  contrast that is pleasing to the eye
- [GitHub Themes (GitHub)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme):
  Classics that work well. The color palette is not very vibrant and the
  constrast is very good. It's the basic that works like a charm

As for icon themes, there are three extensions that I personally love:

- [Symbols (Miguel Solorio)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=miguelsolorio.symbols):
  A great combo with the _Min Theme_. Simple, clean and elegant.
- [VSCode Icons (VSCode Icons Theme)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscode-icons-team.vscode-icons):
  Expressive is the best word for describing this one. If you enjoy richness of
  details, this might be the one for you
- [Material Icon Theme (Philipp Kief)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme):
  Very similar to the previous one, but with the flat design approach. Feels
  like a combination of Symbols' and VSCode Icons' designs

## Fonts

The fonts of your editor have a greater impact on the design than the color
palette of your themes, so it's very important to choose a font that goes along
with the style of your Code setup.

If you work with JavaScript/TypeScript, I'd recommend fonts that have support
ligatures ("combining" various characters into one symbol). There are three
fonts that I recommend trying out:

- [Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code): This font by
  Microsoft is simply beautiful. You'll find it hard to encounter a setup that
  makes this seem bad. It has a rich support to font ligatures and cursive
  characters for italic styles.
- [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/pt-br/lp/mono/): If you enjoy the
  IntelliJ workspace style, this is for you. Characters are easy to read, also
  has great support for font ligatures, and has a elegant, modern touch
- [Geist Mono](https://vercel.com/font/mono): This is a new monospaced font by
  Vercel that looks gourgeous. Modern, easy to read and gives off a minimalist
  feel to your workspace

## VSCode configurations

Now we're gonna dive into Code's visual customization. VSCode allows us to tweak
quite a lot with its layout design, which gives us power to make the editor look
clean and elegant.

Please note that the following changes are applied globally. If you wish to
scope this configuration to a certain workspace, I recommend doing it with
**Profiles**.

First, open up your `settings.json` file (using `Ctrl + Shift + P` and typing
`"User Settings"`). If you wish, remove all previous configurations. Assuming
you've cleared all the settings, you should have this screen:

![Settings.json file](/images/posts/settings-start.png)

Now, let's get to the configurations. First, let's tweak with the editor's
functionalities. Here, you will:

- Enable autosave for files
- Set up tab and text size, font family and line height
- Add rulers to mark line lengths
- Configure start up window (optional)
- Enable multi-cursor modifier (optional)

Here are the settings I use:

Now the fun part: let's change the layout of VSCode. We're going to remove some
things:

- File breadcrumbs
- File minimap
- Status bar
- Scrollbars
- File paths on labels
- Semantic highlighting

Also, we're adding line highlighting with gutter included (the line number
part). Checkout how to do it:

## The result

After all that, you're ready to go! The final result depends on the themes and
fonts you're using, but I can give you an example on how it looks. I'm using the
**Min Theme and Symbols for theme and icons**. As for fonts, I'm using **Geist
Sans for the editor and Geist Mono for code files and terminal windows**.
