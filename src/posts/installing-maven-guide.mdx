Maven is a robust, XML-based project management tool for Java projects. With
Maven, you can easily handle building, deploying and testing your application.

However, installing Maven on Linux distributions can be quite troublesome, since
we have to download the binaries and tweak with some path environment variables.
But not to worry, because we will run through the whole process in details!

## Download the Maven binaries

The [Apache Maven Project](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) offers the most
recent versions of Maven for download in various formats. You can download the binaries
(indicated by the `-bin` suffix) or the source codes (containing the `-src` suffix).

Since we want to install Maven for our personal use, we want to download the `-bin`
versions. You can download either the `.tar.gz` or `.zip` file, whichever you prefer.
Once the file is downloaded, extract its contents to a folder at the root of your user
(e.g. `~/.mvn-binaries`).

## Disabling block for HTTP repositories

Since version 3.8.1, Maven blocks external HTTP repositories by default. If you need to
use a HTTP repository in your projects, do the following:

1. Open a terminal window in the folder where you saved the Maven binaries
2. Open the `config/setting.xml` file
3. Comment out the following section:
   ```xml:config/settings.xml
   <mirror>
     <id>maven-default-http-blocker</id>
     <mirrorOf>external:http:*</mirrorOf>
     <name>Pseudo repository to mirror external repositories initially using HTTP.</name>
     <url><http://0.0.0.0/></url>
     <blocked>true</blocked>
   </mirror>
   ```

## Exporting Maven into your `$PATH`

To enable Maven anywhere in your system, you need to export it into your `$PATH`
variable. For that, follow these steps:

1. In your Maven installation folder, run `realpath apache-maven-X.X.X` and copy
   the output. Remember to pass the version of Maven you've downloaded in the
   command above
2. Create the file `~/.mavenrc` and paste the following code:
   ```bash:.mavenrc
   export MAVEN_HOME=<realpath_output>
   export PATH=$MAVEN_HOME/bin:$PATH
   ```
3. Run the command `source ~/.mavenrc`
4. Run the command `mvn -version` to check the installation

## Autoloading Maven

As of now, every time you open a new terminal window, you would need to run
`source ~/.mavenrc` to load Maven. To automatically load Maven, follow these steps:

1. Open your `~/.bashrc` file
2. At the end of the file, paste the following code:
   ```bash:.bashrc
   if [ -f ~/.mavenrc ]; then
       . ~/.mavenrc
   fi
   ```

This will automatically load the Maven path variables into your `$PATH` everytime
you start a new bash section.
